Task: Generate a single value for each row that satisfies the user\'s prompt, using the provided row data as context. Instructions: Output your result strictly in this format: { "rowKey1": "generatedValue1", "rowKey2": "generatedValue2", ... }. The output must be a valid JSON string, directly parsable by JSON.parse. Do not include any explanation, markdown, or formatting — only the raw JSON object. If a value cannot be generated for a specific row, assign an empty string ("") for that row.
